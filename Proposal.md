# Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade

*A Night At the Cinema*

*Joel Carlson*

## Project Description

In my idea of the project I will be creating a movie theater that the arcade goer can enter into. In my idea that may be more can i can phiscally do, I will have an entrance  with ticketing, a food concession area, and multiple theater screens. Within this idea there will be oppurtunities for the user to interact with the environment. The user will be able to purchase tickets, buy food, choose a movie, and choose a seat within the individual theaters. In the event that this is more than I could with the given time frame and my skill set, I will adapt the project to be a museum where the user is able to go through multiple rooms of different exhibits. The same entrance with ticketing will be there. This will be a fully fledged XR experience with the user being able to interact with the environment.

## Feature Breakdown

1. **Lobby Entrance Area**: This will be the first area the user enters. They will be able to purchase tickets and buy food. 

    **Estimated Challenge - 4:** Technically this may not be the hardest portion, but there will be large amounts of assets and interactions that will need to be created. These are not my strong suit so they will take longer to implement.
2. **Hallways to Theaters**: This will be 2 hallways leading to the theaters. They will be on either end of the lobby. This is just a basic area that will be a connection to theother areas.

    **Estimated Challenge - 2:** This shoudln't be too hard, but it wil be a continuation of the lobby theme so it will just have to match.

3. **Player Interaction: Tickets**: The user will be able to purchase tickets to the movies. This will be a simple interaction where the user will be able to select a movie and purchase a ticket.

    **Estimated Challenge - 3:** This will be a simple interaction, but it will require some UI elements that I have not worked with before and a way to create an object, the ticket, and the player be able to carry it.

4. **Player Interaction: Food**: The Player will be able to go to a concession counter and order food. This will be sort of a few windows with items and the player will be able to select an item and purchase it. The item will then be dispensed to the player.

    **Estimated Challenge - 4:** This will be a simple interaction, but it will require some UI elements that I have not worked with before and a way to create an object, the food, and the player be able to carry it. This will also require some sort of animation to dispense the food.

5. **Theaters**: This is one of the multiple (1-4) theaters will be created. The user will be able to enter the theater and view the room. It will contain multiple seats and a screen.

    **Estimated Challenge - 4:** This will be difficult because of the amount of assets that will need to be created, but the interactions will be simple. The user will be able to select a seat and sit down.

6. **Player Interaction: Seats**: The user will be able to select a seat in the theater. This will be a simple interaction where the user will be able to select a seat and sit down.
    
    **Estimated Challenge - 3:** This will be a simple interaction, but it will require some UI elements that I have not worked with before and a way to create an object, the seat, and the     
    player be able to carry it.



## Milestones

List here the progress you intend to make by each milestone check point. The dates I have represented here are actual due dates for project submissions. These will also be in class time to get feedback from me and other students, so you must have something ready to test by class on each of these days.

1. **By 11/19** - Implemented the Lobby Entrance Area and Hallways to Theaters. This will be the first area the user enters. A basic view of a theater will be done. Operatioons such as purchasing tickets and food will not be implemented yet. This is also where I will make a decision about the project and if I will be able to do the movie theater or if I will have to switch to the museum.
2. **By 12/5** - Implemented the Player Interaction: Tickets and Player Interaction: Food. The user will be able to purchase tickets and food. The user will be able to select a movie and purchase a ticket. The user will be able to go to a concession counter and order food. This will be sort of a few windows with items and the player will be able to select an item and purchase it. The item will then be dispensed to the player. The final item to be done will be making the player sit down and actually watch the movie.

## Inspirations

The concept in general where the player is able to go into the virtual world and watch a movie, but this will be more focued on making it a game with movement: https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/bigscreen-social-movie-vr-paramount-1203439355/

This is some startup trying to do it but on a larger scale: https://sidequestvr.com/app/1523/cinevr

Just will try and make it look like a traditional movie theater: https://www.google.com/search?q=movie+theater&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS821US821&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJ6J6J9J7lAhXQrJ4KHbJzBQoQ_AUIEigB&biw=1920&bih=937
